## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Request limits: at most `server.max_concurrent_requests` (256) requests at
  once (`503`), per client 32 concurrent requests and 120 burst / 20 per
  second (`429`), 20 failed logins per client in 15 minutes; IPv6 per /64,
  bounded client tables. Client addresses from `X-Forwarded-For` only for
  `server.trusted_proxies` (default: loopback, for a reverse proxy on the
  same host; others such as a Docker bridge must be listed).
- Release pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): binaries for Linux,
  macOS and Windows, `SHA256SUMS`, build provenance attestations and a
  signed multi-arch Docker image on `ghcr.io/zeitgleich/calcraft`; see
  [docs/release-verification.md](docs/release-verification.md).

### Fixed

- Web UI: the action column of the user and app-password tables now lines up
  with the other cells; on phone widths the header is compact (user and
  logout next to the name, navigation as a scrollable row below).
